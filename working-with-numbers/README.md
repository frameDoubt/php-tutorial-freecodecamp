# Fifth Lesson - Working With Numbers
---

There are two types of numbers integers \(whole numbers\) and floating point numbers \(decimal numbers\). Math operator include: addition \(+\), subtraction \(-\), multiplication \(*\), division \(/\), modulus \(%\), and exponents \(**\). PHP follows order of operations rules.

```
abs(-100);
```
This function returns the absolute value of a given number.

```
pow(7, 2);
```
This function returns 7 raised to the 2nd power.

```
sqrt(49);
```
This function returns the square root of a given number.

```
max(2, 10, 33, 20, 49);
min(2, 10, 21, -10);
```
These functions return the largest and smallest numbers of given values.

```
round(5.75);
ceil(6.2);
floor(5.9);
```
The round function rounds a given floating point number to the nearest integer value. The ceil function rounds a given floating point number to the next highest integer value. The floor function rounds a given floating point number to the next lowest integer value.
