# Ninth Lesson - URL Parameters

```
localhost:4000/url-parameters/site.php?variable-name=Bob&variable-job=Builder
```
Can store parameters in the URL by having a question mark at the end of the target URL, and parameter name followed with a value stored in it like with the equal sign. If there is more than one parameter, use ambersand to seperate and store the values.
