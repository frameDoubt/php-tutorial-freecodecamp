Tenth Lesson - POST vs GET
---
Form get method passes the password to the browser url, this is insecure. Form post method is more secure, because it doesn't store date in user data in the browser url. Much like the get method, post has global variable accessed using `$_POST["input-name-attribute-value"]` in your php script.
